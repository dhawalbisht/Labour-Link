# Project Overview

Our project serves the dual purpose of connecting both skilled and unskilled laborers seeking employment with users in need of their services. It is particularly beneficial for individuals looking to expand their reach in the job market or those new to a town seeking assistance with tasks such as house renovations, painting, electrical work, and more.

## Nodes in the System

### 1. Labourers
Labourers are the primary users of our website. They can register themselves as workers by submitting necessary documents, including police verification, and providing basic details through a registration form. This step initiates their presence on the platform, making them visible to potential employers.

### 2. Users
Users represent individuals or businesses seeking labor services. They can hire skilled or unskilled laborers based on their specific requirements. To do so, users need to sign in using their phone numbers for authentication, after which they will receive an OTP. The hiring process involves filling out a user form with the necessary details, making a payment on the website, and subsequently receiving an email containing information about the hired laborer.

## Platform Workflow

3. **Confirmation and Communication:**
